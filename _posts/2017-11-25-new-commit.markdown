I've created a new feature. The player can now walk near the enemies and they become more visible as the player gets closer.
If the enemies get too far away they disappear entirely. This is slightly different from the map tiles. Map tiles become 'hazy' as you get further away from them. Map tiles don't move. So we imagine the player has a 'sense' of where they are. Monsters move when outside the player's field of vision. So they go invisible when they get too far from the player.

Overall this was a fun challenge. I had to repeat a method from the Tiles class. Which I'm not crazy about. But that's what refactoring is for.

Here's a gif of the working game.
